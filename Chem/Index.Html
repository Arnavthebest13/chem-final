            <div class="text6">Common or trade name: Clorox Bleach</div>
            <div class="text7">Bleach has been used for centuries, with evidence of its use dating back to ancient Egypt. It became more widely used in<br>ㅤthe 18th and 19th centuries for textile bleaching and water purification, and has since become a common household<br>ㅤㅤcleaning and disinfecting agent. The overall purpose of bleach is to disinfect surfaces, whiten clothes, and remove<br>ㅤㅤㅤstains. It is commonly used in households, hospitals, and industries for cleaning and sanitizing purposes.</div>

            <div class="text12">Ingredients and Their Roles in Bleach</div>
            <div class="text13">The 3 main ingredients and their chemical structures:<br>ㅤ-ㅤSodium Hypochlorite (NaClO)<br>ㅤ-ㅤSodium Hydroxide (NaOH)<br>ㅤ-ㅤSodium Polyacrylate (C3H3NaO2)</div>
            <div class="text14">Explanation of the purpose of each of the 3 main ingredients:</div>
            <div class="text15">ㅤ-ㅤSODIUM HYPOCHLORITE:<br>It is a strong oxidizing agent and disinfectant that is used to kill bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms. It is also used to remove stains and whiten clothes.<br><br>ㅤ-ㅤSODIUM HYDROXIDE:<br>It is a strong base and is used to adjust the pH of the bleach solution to around 11-12. This high pH helps to activate the Sodium Hypochlorite and enhance its disinfectant properties.<br><br>ㅤ-ㅤSODIUM POLYACRYLATE:<br>It is a polymer that is added to the bleach solution to thicken it and make it easier to use.</div>
            <div class="text16">Some common additional ingredients that may be found in bleach and their functions:</div>
            <div class="text17">FRAGRANCES: Bleach can have a strong chemical odor, and manufacturers may add fragrances to improve the<br>smell of the product.<br><br>SURFACTANTS: These are compounds that help to break down and disperse dirt and grime, making it easier for<br>the bleach to clean surfaces. They can also help the bleach to spread more evenly across surfaces.<br><br>STABILIZERS: Bleach is a highly reactive substance and can break down over time. Stabilizers are added to the<br>bleach to prevent it from breaking down and losing its effectiveness.<br><br>SODIUM CARBONATE: Also known as washing soda, this is an alkaline substance that is added to some bleach<br>products to help boost their cleaning power.<br><br>COLORANTS: Some bleach products are colored, usually to help consumers differentiate between different<br>products or to make it easier to see where the bleach has been applied.
